# CSS Advanced

This project is part of the ALX Front-End curriculum and builds directly on the previous **HTML Advanced** project. The goal here is to create the full structural HTML of the SmileSchool homepage and prepare it for styling using pure CSS only. No external frameworks or libraries may be used.

You will reproduce the layout provided in the Figma design using semantic HTML, good structure, and clean file organization. The CSS implementation will come in later tasks.
